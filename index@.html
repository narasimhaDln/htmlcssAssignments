    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <dfn>periodic table</dfn> is a tabular arrangement of chemical
      elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as
      <var>Fe</var> for iron, <var>H</var> for hydrogen, and <var>O</var> for
      oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their
      properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an
      example of a chemical reaction:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var>H</var
      ><sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (<var>O</var><sub>2</sub>) to form water
      (<var>H</var><sub>2</sub>O).
    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>
      <strong>Stoichiometry</strong> is the calculation of reactants and
      products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations
      to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule,
      while superscripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
      Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our
      bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
